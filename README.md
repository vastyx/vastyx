# ðŸ‘‹ hey, I'm jasin


## ðŸš€ About Me
- ðŸŽ¯ Passionate about systems programming, performance engineering and defensive security research  
- ðŸ”¥ Always exploring hardware/software boundaries and designing robust, production-grade mitigations
---

## ðŸ§  Areas of Expertise
- **Low-level Systems & Drivers** â€” kernel-mode development (Windows & Linux), device driver patterns, safe driver design  
- **DMA Research & Threat Modeling** â€” DMA mapping, IOMMU behavior, firmware/driver interactions, detection heuristics  
- **Reverse Engineering & Binary Analysis** â€” static & dynamic analysis, Ghidra/IDA scripting, automated artifact extraction  
- **Memory Forensics & Runtime Integrity** â€” live memory acquisition, anomaly detection, attestation primitives  
- **High-Performance Computing** â€” CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL, zero-copy memory optimizations for low-latency workloads  
- **Networking & Protocols** â€” low-latency stacks, QUIC/TCP tuning, and secure networking primitives  
- **Tooling & Automation** â€” fuzzing harnesses, CI for driver testing, telemetry & large-scale analysis pipelines

---

## ðŸ“š Research & Lab Practices
- Experiments are run in isolated lab environments (air-gapped VMs, hardware testbeds) with reproducible artifacts and strict audit trails.  
- Responsible disclosure: vulnerabilities discovered are coordinated with vendors and operators prior to any public release.  
- I use a combination of deterministic instrumentation, hardware counters, and custom fuzzing to validate hypotheses.
